# xv6 System Call Background

To be able to implement this project, you'll have to understand a little bit
about how xv6 implements system calls. As you recall from the [OS
book](http://www.ostep.org/), a system call is a protected transfer of control
from an application (running in *user mode*) to the OS (running in *kernel
mode*). The general approach, which we refer to as *limited direct execution*
(*LDE*), enables the kernel to maintain control of the machine while generally
letting user applications run efficiently and without kernel intervention.

We'll specifically trace what happens in the code in order to understand a
*system call*. System calls allow the operating system to run code on the
behalf of user requests but in a protected manner, both by jumping into the
kernel (in a very specific and restricted way) and also by simultaneously
raising the privilege level of the hardware, so that the OS can perform
certain restricted operations.

## System Call Overview

Before delving into the details, we first provide an overview of the entire
process. The problem we are trying to solve is simple: how can we build a
system such that the OS is allowed access to all of the resources of the
machine (including access to special instructions, to physical memory,
and to any devices) while user programs are only able to do so in a restricted
manner? 

The way we achieve this goal is with hardware support. The hardware must
explicitly have a notion of privilege built into it, and thus be able to
distinguish when the OS is running versus typical user applications. 

## Getting Into The Kernel: A Trap

The first step in a system call begins at user-level with an application. The
application that wishes to make a system call (such as **read()**) calls the
relevant library routine. However, all the library version of the system call
does is to place the proper arguments in relevant registers and issue some
kind of **trap** instruction, as we see in an expanded version of **usys.S**
(Some macros are used to define these functions so as to make life
easier for the kernel developer; the example shows the macro expanded to the
actual assembly code).

```
.globl read; 
read: 
  movl $6, %eax; 
  int $64; 
  ret
```
File: **usys.S**

Here we can see that the **read()** library function actually doesn't do much
at all; it moves the value 5 into the register **%eax** and issues the x86
trap instruction which is confusingly called **int** (short for *interrupt*).
The value in **%eax** is going to be used by the kernel to *vector* to the
right system call, i.e., it determines which system call is being invoked. The
**int** instruction takes one argument (here it is 64), which tells the
hardware which trap type this is. In xv6, trap 64 is used to handle system
calls. Any other arguments which are passed to the system call are passed on
the stack. 

## Kernel Side: Trap Tables

Once the **int** instruction is executed, the hardware takes over and does a
bunch of work on behalf of the caller. One important thing the hardware does
is to raise the *privilege level* of the CPU to kernel mode; on x86 this is
usually means moving from a *CPL* *(Current Privilege Level)* of 3 (the level
at which user applications run) to CPL 0 (in which the kernel runs). Yes,
there are a couple of in-between privilege levels, but most systems do not
make use of these.

The second important thing the hardware does is to transfer control to the
*trap vectors* of the system. To enable the hardware to know what code to run
when a particular trap occurs, the OS, when booting, must make sure to inform
the hardware of the location of the code to run when such traps take
place. This is done in **main.c** as follows:

```c
int
mainc(void)
{
   ...
   tvinit(); // trap vectors initialized here
   ...
}
```
FILE: **main.c**

The routine **tvinit()** is the relevant one here. Peeking inside of it, we
see: 

```c
void tvinit(void)
{
  int i;

  for(i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    SETGATE(idt[i], 0, SEG_KCODE<<3, vectors[i], 0);

  // this is the line we care about...
  SETGATE(idt[T_SYSCALL], 1, SEG_KCODE<<3, vectors[T_SYSCALL], DPL_USER);

  initlock(&tickslock, "time");
}
```
FILE: **trap.c**

The **SETGATE()** macro is the relevant code here. It is used to set the
**idt** array to point to the proper code to execute when various traps and
interrupts occur. For system calls, the single **SETGATE()** call (which 
comes after the loop) is the one we're interested in. Here is what the macro
does (as well as the gate descriptor it sets): 

```c
// Gate descriptors for interrupts and traps
struct gatedesc {
  uint off_15_0 : 16;   // low 16 bits of offset in segment
  uint cs : 16;         // code segment selector
  uint args : 5;        // # args, 0 for interrupt/trap gates
  uint rsv1 : 3;        // reserved(should be zero I guess)
  uint type : 4;        // type(STS_{TG,IG32,TG32})
  uint s : 1;           // must be 0 (system)
  uint dpl : 2;         // descriptor(meaning new) privilege level
  uint p : 1;           // Present
  uint off_31_16 : 16;  // high bits of offset in segment
};

// Set up a normal interrupt/trap gate descriptor.
// - istrap: 1 for a trap (= exception) gate, 0 for an interrupt gate.
//   interrupt gate clears FL_IF, trap gate leaves FL_IF alone
// - sel: Code segment selector for interrupt/trap handler
// - off: Offset in code segment for interrupt/trap handler
// - dpl: Descriptor Privilege Level -
//        the privilege level required for software to invoke
//        this interrupt/trap gate explicitly using an int instruction.
#define SETGATE(gate, istrap, sel, off, d)                \
{                                                         \
  (gate).off_15_0 = (uint) (off) & 0xffff;                \
  (gate).cs = (sel);                                      \
  (gate).args = 0;                                        \
  (gate).rsv1 = 0;                                        \
  (gate).type = (istrap) ? STS_TG32 : STS_IG32;           \
  (gate).s = 0;                                           \
  (gate).dpl = (d);                                       \
  (gate).p = 1;                                           \
  (gate).off_31_16 = (uint) (off) >> 16;                  \
}
```
FILE: **mmu.h**

As you can see from the code, all the **SETGATE()** macros does is set the
values of an in-memory data structure. Most important is the **off**
parameter, which tells the hardware where the trap handling code is.  In the
initialization code, the value **vectors[T_SYSCALL]** is passed in; thus,
whatever the **vectors** array points to will be the code to run when a system
call takes place. There are other details (which are important too); consult
an [x86 hardware architecture
manuals](http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals) (particularly
Chapters 3a and 3b) for more information.

Note, however, that we still have not informed the hardware of this
information, but rather filled a data structure. The actual hardware informing
occurs a little later in the boot sequence; in xv6, it happens in the routine
**mpmain()** in the file **main.c**, which calls **idtinit** in **trap.c**,
which calls **lidt()** in the include file **x86.h**:

```c
static void
mpmain(void)
{
  idtinit();
  ...

void
idtinit(void)
{
  lidt(idt, sizeof(idt));
}

static inline void
lidt(struct gatedesc *p, int size)
{
  volatile ushort pd[3];

  pd[0] = size-1;
  pd[1] = (uint)p;
  pd[2] = (uint)p >> 16;

  asm volatile("lidt (%0)" : : "r" (pd));
}
```

Here, you can see how (eventually) a single assembly instruction is called to
tell the hardware where to find the *interrupt descriptor table (IDT)* in
memory. Note this is done in **mpmain()** as each processor in the system
must have such a table (they all use the same one of course). Finally, after
executing this instruction (which is only possible when the kernel is running,
in privileged mode), we are ready to think about what happens when a user
application invokes a system call.

```c
struct trapframe {
  // registers as pushed by pusha
  uint edi;
  uint esi;
  uint ebp;
  uint oesp;      // useless & ignored
  uint ebx;
  uint edx;
  uint ecx;
  uint eax;

  // rest of trap frame
  ushort es;
  ushort padding1;
  ushort ds;
  ushort padding2;
  uint trapno;

  // below here defined by x86 hardware
  uint err;
  uint eip;
  ushort cs;
  ushort padding3;
  uint eflags;

  // below here only when crossing rings, such as from user to kernel
  uint esp;
  ushort ss;
  ushort padding4;
};
```
File: **x86.h**

## From Low-level To The C Trap Handler

The OS has carefully set up its trap handlers, and thus we are ready to see
what happens on the OS side once an application issues a system call via the
**int** instruction. Before any code is run, the hardware must perform a
number of tasks. The first thing it does are those tasks which are
difficult/impossible for the software to do itself, including saving the
current PC (IP or EIP in Intel terminology) onto the stack, as well as a
number of other registers such as the **eflags** register (which contains the
current status of the CPU while the program was running), stack pointer, and
so forth. One can see what the hardware is expected to save by looking at the
**trapframe** structure as defined in **x86.h**.

As you can see from the bottom of the trapframe structure, some pieces of the
trap frame are filled in by the hardware (up to the **err** field); the rest
will be saved by the OS. The first code OS that is run is **vector64()**
as found in **vectors.S** (which is automatically generated by the script
**vectors.pl**). 

```c
.globl vector64
vector64:
  pushl $64
  jmp alltraps
```
File: **vectors.S** (generated by **vectors.pl**)

This code pushes the trap number onto the stack (filling in the **trapno**
field of the trap frame) and then calls **alltraps()** to do most of the
saving of context into the trap frame.

```
  # vectors.S sends all traps here.
.globl alltraps
alltraps:
  # Build trap frame.
  pushl %ds
  pushl %es
  pushal

  # Set up data segments.
  movl $SEG_KDATA_SEL, %eax
  movw %ax,%ds
  movw %ax,%es

  # Call trap(tf), where tf=%esp
  pushl %esp
  call trap
  addl $4, %esp
```
File: **trapasm.S**

The code in **alltraps()** pushes a few more segment registers (not described
here, yet) onto the stack before pushing the remaining general purpose
registers onto the trap frame via a **pushal** instruction. Then, the OS
changes the descriptor segment and extra segment registers so that it can
access its own (kernel) memory. Finally, the C trap handler is called.

## The C Trap Handler

Once done with the low-level details of setting up the trap frame, the
low-level assembly code calls up into a generic C trap handler called
**trap()**, which is passed a pointer to the trap frame. This trap handler is
called upon all types of interrupts and traps, and thus check the trap number
field of the trap frame (**trapno**) to determine what to do. The first check
is for the system call trap number (**T_SYSCALL**, or 64 as defined somewhat
arbitrarily in **traps.h**), which then handles the system call, as you see
here:

```c
void
trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
  if(tf->trapno == T_SYSCALL){
    if(cp->killed)
      exit();
    cp->tf = tf;
    syscall();
    if(cp->killed)
      exit();
    return;
  }
  ... // continues
}  
```
FILE: **trap.c**

The code isn't too complicated. It checks if the current process (that made
the system call) has been killed; if so, it simply exits and cleans up the
process (and thus does not proceed with the system call). It then calls
**syscall()** to actually perform the system call; more details on that
below. Finally, it checks whether the process has been killed again before
returning. Note that we'll follow the return path below in more detail.

```c
static int (*syscalls[])(void) = {
[SYS_chdir]   sys_chdir,
[SYS_close]   sys_close,
[SYS_dup]     sys_dup,
[SYS_exec]    sys_exec,
[SYS_exit]    sys_exit,
[SYS_fork]    sys_fork,
[SYS_fstat]   sys_fstat,
[SYS_getpid]  sys_getpid,
[SYS_kill]    sys_kill,
[SYS_link]    sys_link,
[SYS_mkdir]   sys_mkdir,
[SYS_mknod]   sys_mknod,
[SYS_open]    sys_open,
[SYS_pipe]    sys_pipe,
[SYS_read]    sys_read,
[SYS_sbrk]    sys_sbrk,
[SYS_sleep]   sys_sleep,
[SYS_unlink]  sys_unlink,
[SYS_wait]    sys_wait,
[SYS_write]   sys_write,
};

void
syscall(void)
{
  int num;
  
  num = cp->tf->eax;
  if(num >= 0 && num < NELEM(syscalls) && syscalls[num])
    cp->tf->eax = syscalls[num]();
  else {
    cprintf("%d %s: unknown sys call %d\n", 
        cp->pid, cp->name, num);
    cp->tf->eax = -1;
  }
}
]
```
File: **syscall.c**

## Vectoring To The System Call

Once we finally get to the **syscall()** routine in **syscall.c**, not much
work is left to do (see above). The system call number has been passed to us
in the register **%eax**, and now we unpack that number from the trap frame
and use it to call the appropriate routine as defined in the system call table
**syscalls[]**. Pretty much all operating systems have a table similar to this
to define the various system calls they support. After carefully checking that
the system call number is in bounds, the pointed-to routine is called to
handle the call. For example, if the system call **read()** was called by the
user, the routine **sys_read()** will be invoked here. The return value, you
might note, is stored in **%eax** to pass back to the user.

## The Return Path

The return path is pretty easy. First, the system call returns an integer
value, which the code in **syscall()** grabs and places into the **%eax**
field of the trap frame. The code then returns into **trap()**, which simply
returns into where it was called from in the assembly trap handler.

```c
  # Return falls through to trapret...
.globl trapret
trapret:
  popal
  popl %es
  popl %ds
  addl $0x8, %esp  # trapno and errcode
  iret
```
File: **trapasm.S**

This return code doesn't do too much, just making sure to pop the relevant
values off the stack to restore the context of the running process. Finally,
one more special instruction is called: **iret**, or the **return-from-trap**
instruction. This instruction is similar to a return from a procedure call,
but simultaneously lowers the privilege level back to user mode and jumps back
to the instruction immediately following the **int** instruction called to
invoke the system call, restoring all the state that has been saved into the
trap frame. At this point, the user stub for **read()** (as seen in the
**usys.S** code) is run again, which just uses a normal
return-from-procedure-call instruction (**ret**) in order to return to the
caller.

## Summary

We have seen the path in and out of the kernel on a system call. As you can
tell, it is much more complex than a simple procedure call, and requires a
careful protocol on behalf of the OS and hardware to ensure that application
state is properly saved and restored on entry and return. As always, the
concept is easy: with operating systems, the devil is always in the details.
